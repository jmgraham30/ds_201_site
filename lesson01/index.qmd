## Learning Objectives

After this lesson, students will be able to: 

* Give an general definition of **data science**.

* Explain what is meant by **reproducible** and **auditable** workflows.

* Use the [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/) online tools (link [here](https://www.gapminder.org/)) to explore data on certain social and economic issues.

* Explain and give examples of **numerical** and **categorical** data types.  

* Do basic arithmetic with R. 

## Readings, etc.


For this lesson, refer to the following readings, etc.:

* Read the preface of *Data Science: A First Introduction* by Tiffany Timbers, Trevor Campbell, and Melissa Lee [@timbers2022data]. This textbook is available online [here](https://datasciencebook.ca/).

* Skim the README for the [Tidy Tuesday data repository](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) [@TT]. Click [link here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) to go to the Tidy Tuesday data repository. Throughout the semester, we will use example data from the Tidy Tuesday data repository.


## What is Data Science?

## A Tiny Bit of R

### Why R?

The [R language](https://www.r-project.org/) [@r2023] for statistical computing is one of the most popular computing tools for data science, among the other [most popular](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/top-programming-languages-for-data-scientists-in-2022) are [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Julia](https://julialang.org/). Some of the strengths of R include

* free and open source which facilitates reproducibility and auditability, 

* ecosystem of packages that greatly extend the functionality of R,

* [rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) [@rmarkdown2020] and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) frameworks for [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) enable presentation and communication of data analyses and facilitate reproducibility and auditability, 

* [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) [integrated development environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) (IDE) by [Posit](https://posit.co/) enhances programming, RStudio also supports other languages like Python and Julia making it possible to work across different languages, 

* a strong and collaborative user community, see R Community Explorer website [here](https://r-community.org/usergroups/). 

As the course progresses, we will learn a lot of R. For this less, we will start with something very simple, that is, doing basic calculations with R. 

### Calculations with R


If you want to engage further with R programming, we highly recommend the [swirl](https://swirlstats.com/) package [@swirl2020] for learning R in R. To install, load, and use swirl, run the following commands in the R console:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: false
#| eval: false

# this is a comment and is not run
# install swirl
install.packages("swirl") # only need to run once
# load swirl 
library(swirl) # must run in every new R session
# start swirl
swirl()
```

## Expand for Session Info
```{r}
#| echo: false


library(sessioninfo)
# save the session info as an object
pkg_sesh <- session_info(pkgs = "attached")

# get the quarto version
quarto_version <- system("quarto --version", intern = TRUE)

# inject the quarto info
pkg_sesh$platform$quarto <- paste(
  system("quarto --version", intern = TRUE), 
  "@", 
  quarto::quarto_path()
  )

# print it out
pkg_sesh
```
