    "section": "What is Data Science?",
    "text": "What is Data Science?\nFor this course, we think of data science as a methodology or set of methodologies for gaining insight from data. Data can be pretty much any type of organized information. In this course, data will often be organized in a tabular format such as is common with spreadsheets. However, text, images, videos, and sound are other types of data that data scientists often work with. Further, data may have a temporal or spatial component.\nIt is important to note that data science is an interdisciplinary endeavor. Data science brings together mathematics and statistics, computer science and machine learning, and a domain of application or expertise. This is illustrated by Figure 1.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Data science is an inherently interdisciplinary field.\n\n\n\nData Science Workflow\nIn this course, we emphasize a certain workflow for typical data science tasks. Generally, the steps in the workflow are:\n\nGather data with the goal of using it to gain insight to answer questions or address problems in a specific domain of application.\nDocument the data and data collection process.\n\nIt is important to think carefully about the type of data that is collected and how the data is generated and collected. Data is often generated or collected in such a way that it will contain or reflect biases, misinformation, incomplete information, or other problematic features. When you use data or models to make a decision, the problematic features of the data may influence the decision made with unforeseen negative consequences. See The Alignment Problem by Brian Christian for a thoughtful discussion on the issues related to these types of considerations (Christian 2020).\n\nImport the data for analysis.\nExplore and clean the data. Data visualization is essential at this step.\nGenerate initial insight or more detailed questions.\nDecide what type(s) of analysis or analyses are to be performed.\n\nMake sure to clearly state what the goals of an analysis are. There are several different types of analyses of data that are common to conduct. See Table 1.1 from (Timbers, Campbell, and Lee 2022) for a list of these typical analysis types with corresponding examples of questions appropriate for a particular type of analysis, link to table here.\n\nAssess the analysis.\nAt this stage, it may be necessary to repeat steps 1 - 7.\nReport your findings/results documenting each step in the analysis, and state your conclusions in the context of the question, problem, or application that motivated your analysis.\n\nIt is essential the our data science workflow be reproducible and auditable. That is, each step in a data analysis should be accessible and understandable to others (auditability) and anyone with access to your analysis should be able to re-run the analysis from start to finish and get the same result you did (reproducibility). Figure 2 illustrates the concept of reproducibility.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Artwork by Allison Horst"

We will often find it very useful to work with data that conforms to the tidy format.\nWe refer to variables made up of quantitative information as numerical and variables made up of qualitative information as categorical. For example, in the Gapminder data, the country and continent variables are categorical while the year, life expectancy, population, and per capita GDP are all numerical variables. The type of variable(s) often influences the type of visualization or analysis that is used to explore and model data.\nWe can further classify the type of a variable by the following classifications:\n\nNumerical (quantitative):\n\nContinuous: Can take on any value (possibly over a specific range) and any value between two values. Typically will involve decimal values. Physical measurements are common types of continuous numerical data.\nDiscrete: Any numerical type that is not continuous. Often whole numbers. Counts are a common type of discrete numerical data.\n\nCategorical (qualitative):\n\nNominal: Lacks any particular ordering. For example, eyecolor would be nominal categorical data.\nOrdinal: Possesses a particular ordering. For example, the place (first, second, third, etc.) that a sports team comes in at the end of a competition or tournament.\nBinary: A categorical variable with only two possible outcomes. Think yes/no, true/false, etc.\n\n\nFigure 3 illustrates numerical variables and the distinction between continuous and discrete numerical variables, while Figure 4 illustrates categorical variables and the distinction between nominal, ordinal, and binary categorical variables.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Numerical variables and the distinction between a continuous numerical variable and a discrete numerical variable. Artwork by Allison Horst\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Categorical variables and the distinction between nominal, ordinal, and binary categorical variables. Artwork by Allison Horst\n\n\nOne thing to be careful about is that numbers can and often are used to label the outcomes for a categorical variable. For example, suppose we collect data about students living in a particular dormitory. We may use 1 to denote that a student is enrolled as a first-year student, 2 to denote that a student is enrolled as a second-year student, etc. Even though we’ve used number, the year a student is enrolled as is really a categorical variable.\nSometimes, there may even be an ambiguity in the type for a variable. For example, suppose we are collecting data on commercial buildings in a particular city and for each building in the data set, we record (among other things) the number of stories of the building using 1 to denote a building with one story, 2 to denote a building with two stories, etc. On the one hand, we could view our stories variable as a count and hence a discrete numerical variable. On the other hand, it might be better to think of the stories variable as a ordinal categorical variable. One way to decide which is more appropriate is to think about if it makes sense or is desirable to take a average or not. If you want to take a average, then the variable must be numerical."

    "text": "A Tiny Bit of R\n\n\n\nArtwork by Allison Horst\n\n\n\nWhy R?\nThe R language (R Core Team 2023) for statistical computing is one of the most popular computing tools for data science, among the other most popular are Python and Julia. Some of the strengths of R include\n\nfree and open source which facilitates reproducibility and auditability,\necosystem of packages that greatly extend the functionality of R,\nrmarkdown (Xie, Dervieux, and Riederer 2020) and Quarto frameworks for literate programming enable presentation and communication of data analyses and facilitate reproducibility and auditability,\nRStudio integrated development environment (IDE) by Posit enhances programming, RStudio also supports other languages like Python and Julia making it possible to work across different languages,\na strong and collaborative user community, see R Community Explorer website here.\n\nAs the course progresses, we will learn a lot of R. For this lesson, we will start with something very simple, that is, doing basic calculations with R.\n\n\nCalculations with R\nIn R, it is easy to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and modular division. Each of these is illustrated in the following code blocks:\n\n# any line starting with # is a comment and is not run\n# addition\n1.6 + 2.31\n\n[1] 3.91\n\n\n\n# subtraction\n4.87 - 2.31\n\n[1] 2.56\n\n\n\n# multiplication\n1.6 * 2.31\n\n[1] 3.696\n\n\n\n# division\n6.0 / 2.31\n\n[1] 2.597403\n\n\n\n# exponentiation\n2^3\n\n[1] 8\n\n\n\n# modular division, a %% b returns the remainder after\n# dividing a by b\n\n7 %% 2\n\n[1] 1\n\n\nYou have to be careful with the order of operations, use parentheses to be precise about intended order of operations. For example,\n\n(6 / 3) - 1\n\n[1] 1\n\n\ndivides 6 by three and then subtracts 1, while\n\n6 / (3 - 1)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nsubtracts 1 from 3 and divides 6 by the result. While the following code runs and has a specific meaning to the computer, it is ambiguous to the human reader and should be modified appropriately with parentheses:\n\n6 / 3 - 1\n\n[1] 1\n\n\n\n\nVariables and Assignment\nIn R programming, a variable is a name given to a R object such as a numeric value that can be used to store, reuse, or modify that object. In R, variable assignments are made use the assignment operator &lt;-. For example,\n\nmy_variable &lt;- 2.5\n\nassigns the numeric value 2.5 to the variable my_variable. Now, we can peform operations to my_variable, for example,\n\n(2 * my_variable)\n\n[1] 5\n\n(my_variable^3)\n\n[1] 15.625\n\n\nMany programming languages use = for assignment. While it is valid to use = in R, best practices dictate using &lt;-.\nSee the tidyverse style guide here for best practices in naming objects in R.\nIf you want to engage further with R programming, we highly recommend the swirl package (Kross et al. 2020) for learning R in R. To install, load, and use swirl, run the following commands in the R console:\n\n# install swirl\ninstall.packages(\"swirl\") # only need to run once\n# load swirl \nlibrary(swirl) # must run in every new R session\n# start swirl\nswirl()"

    "section": "Use of AI",
    "text": "Use of AI\nArtificial intelligence (AI) can be an effective tool in data science. For example, AI-based programming assistants like GitHub Copilot or generative model platforms like ChatGPT now help programmers and developers to write better code in less time. Learning to use AI is essentially becoming a basic skill for the modern data scientist. Because of this, I do not want to completely discourage the use of AI assistance.\nHowever, I ask that you avoid using AI platforms or tools in a manner that is inappropriate in the context of this course. This course teaches a variety of concepts, skills, and critical thinking. Using AI in such a way as to avoid learning, developing skills, or critical thinking is not appropriate. If you find yourself using AI to look up answers, search for complete solutions to problems, or things like this, then your use of AI is not acceptable. It might be helpful to think of AI as an analog to a calculator. If the goal of an assignment is for you to demonstrate that you can do a certain calculation, then using a calculator is not appropriate. On the other hand, if the goal of an assignment is for you to demonstrate that you can solve a problem for which a minor step involves doing a calculation, then using a calculator is okay. AI should be treated analogously.\nIn particular, it is expected that students will be able to explain independently and in detail what any line of code submitted as part of an assignment this semester does. Also, it is expected that students can explain independently and in detail the solution to any problem submitted as part of an assignment this semester.\nIf you have any doubts about your use of AI, then either ask the instructor if your use of AI is acceptable or just don’t use AI."

In some cases, you will be asked to go through the notebooks on your own and sometimes we will go through the notebooks together during class. Either way, any time you encounter code in a notebook, it is expected that you will take the time to run any code (mostly by copying and pasting) for yourself.

Using a project facilitates reproducible and auditable analyses because it keeps all the relevant files for a specific analysis together in one place making it easier to share. A RStudio project should correspond to a single project that you are working on. For example, you should use a RStudio project for your semester project for the course.\nThe instructions for how to create a project are given in the online Posit support documents, view the projects webpage. Alternatively, view this video:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Project Tips and Tricks\n\nWhen you create a project, the name of you project and the name of the corresponding folder will be the same.
