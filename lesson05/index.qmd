## Learning Objectives

After this lesson, students will be able to: 

- Write functions in R.

- Use `map` and other such functions from `purrr` for iteration. 


## Readings, etc.

For this lesson, refer to the following readings, etc.:

- [Chapter 26](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/functions) from [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) [@wickham2023r]. [View Chapter 26](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/functions).

- [Chapter 27](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/iteration) from [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) [@wickham2023r]. [View Chapter 27](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/iteration).


## Overview

Computer programming is the art and science of instructing computers to perform specific tasks or solve problems. It's like giving step-by-step directions to a computer to execute. Programmers use programming languages, which are like the computer's communication tools, to write code. This code is a set of instructions that tells the computer what to do. In the world of data science, programming is an essential skill because it allows you to manipulate, analyze, and visualize data efficiently. Learning to code empowers you to create software, build data models, and automate repetitive tasks, making it a fundamental skill for anyone aspiring to excel in the field of data science.

Two of the most important programming concepts are iteration and functions. Both **iteration** and **functions** save us time, iterations by allowing us to perform repetitive tasks without repeating command, and  **functions** by allowing us to generalize commands/code. In data science, iteration and functions are critical for tasks like data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. They enable you to process and analyze large datasets efficiently while maintaining clean, organized, and readable code.

In this lesson, we will learn how to implement functions and certain types of iteration in R.
