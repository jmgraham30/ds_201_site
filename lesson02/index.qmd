## Learning Objectives

After this lesson, students will be able to: 

* Set up an RStudio project.

* Work in a Quarto document.

* Read tabular data into R.

* Use the `glimpse` command and other R functions to examine data read into R.  

## Readings, etc.

For this lesson, refer to the following readings, etc.:

* Chapter 2 of *Data Science: A First Introduction* by Tiffany Timbers, Trevor Campbell, and Melissa Lee [@timbers2022data]. [View the free online version of the text.](https://datasciencebook.ca/).

* The TidyTuesday data repository [@TT].


## RStudio Projects

A RStudio project is simply a folder or directory on a computer that contains a `.Rproj` file. A project makes it so that your work has its own working directory, workspace, history, and source documents. Using a project facilitates reproducible and auditable analyses because it keeps all the relevant files for a specific analysis together in one place making it easier to share. A RStudio project should correspond to a single project that you are working on. For example, you should use a RStudio project for your semester project for the course. 

The instructions for how to create a project are given in the online Posit support documents, [view the projects webpage](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-RStudio-Projects#:~:text=To%20create%20a\%20new%20project,extension%29%20within%20the%20project%20directory.).

### Some Project Tips and Tricks

1. When you create a project, the name of you project and the name of the corresponding folder will be the same. So, using good naming conventions for projects. In particular, avoid the use of spaces or symbols. Make sure the name is descriptive and easy to remember but not too long. 

2. If there is data for your project, it is useful to create a subfolder of your package folder called `data` where you should save all the data files relevant to your project. 

3. If your project involves a lot of coding in R, its a good idea to create a subfolder of your package folder called `R` where you should save all the R script files relevant to your project. 

## Quarto Documents

[Literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) is a programming practice in which the programmer includes computer code, normal text, figures, mathematical notation, etc. together into a single document. The approach is routinely in data science for the purposes of reproducible research. There are several tools for literate programming that are very popular among data scientists. These include but are not limited to [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and [rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).

A very recent addition to the literate programming toolkit is [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). Quarto brings together Jupyter notebooks, rmarkdown, and a number of other features. Throughout this course we will use Quarto which is included with the most recent versions of RStudio. To start using Quarto, we recommend:

*  Getting started with Quarto YouTube video, [watch the video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/YK6IjJkjkiI).

## Reading Data into R

The main focus of this lesson is to show different common ways to read tabular data into R. Recall that tabular data is data that corresponds to a spreadsheet in which data is arranged into columns and rows. There are three basic things you need to know to read data into R:

1. The data format and file type.

For data to be tabular in structure, one must use some method to distinguish entries that belong to different columns and rows. The two most common ways are to separate entries using either a comma or a tab. Tabular data formatted using comma-separated values are saved as `.csv` files while tabular data formatted using tab-separated values are save as `.tsv` files. The other very common way to format and save tabular data is using Excel spreadsheets. 

2. Where the data is saved and will be read in from.

There are two basic locations in which one may save and store a data file: locally on a computer, remotely. 

3. The appropriate R function to use depending on the 1. and 2.

The `readr` package included as part of the `tidyverse` family of R packages contains functions `read_csv` and `read_tsv` for reading in `.csv` or `.tsv` files, respectively. The `readxl` package contains functions that can be used to read in tabular data formatted and saved as Excel spreadsheets.
