    "section": "A Tiny Bit of R",
    "text": "A Tiny Bit of R\n\n\n\nArtwork by Allison Horst\n\n\n\nWhy R?\nThe R language (R Core Team 2023) for statistical computing is one of the most popular computing tools for data science, among the other most popular are Python and Julia. Some of the strengths of R include\n\nfree and open source which facilitates reproducibility and auditability,\necosystem of packages that greatly extend the functionality of R,\nrmarkdown (Xie, Dervieux, and Riederer 2020) and Quarto frameworks for literate programming enable presentation and communication of data analyses and facilitate reproducibility and auditability,\nRStudio integrated development environment (IDE) by Posit enhances programming, RStudio also supports other languages like Python and Julia making it possible to work across different languages,\na strong and collaborative user community, see R Community Explorer website here.\n\nAs the course progresses, we will learn a lot of R. For this lesson, we will start with something very simple, that is, doing basic calculations with R.\n\n\nCalculations with R\nIn R, it is easy to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and modular division. Each of these is illustrated in the following code blocks:\n\n# any line starting with # is a comment and is not run\n# addition\n1.6 + 2.31\n\n[1] 3.91\n\n\n\n# subtraction\n4.87 - 2.31\n\n[1] 2.56\n\n\n\n# multiplication\n1.6 * 2.31\n\n[1] 3.696\n\n\n\n# division\n6.0 / 2.31\n\n[1] 2.597403\n\n\n\n# exponentiation\n2^3\n\n[1] 8\n\n\n\n# modular division, a %% b returns the remainder after\n# dividing a by b\n\n7 %% 2\n\n[1] 1\n\n\nYou have to be careful with the order of operations, use parentheses to be precise about intended order of operations. For example,\n\n(6 / 3) - 1\n\n[1] 1\n\n\ndivides 6 by three and then subtracts 1, while\n\n6 / (3 - 1)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nsubtracts 1 from 3 and divides 6 by the result. While the following code runs and has a specific meaning to the computer, it is ambiguous to the human reader and should be modified appropriately with parentheses:\n\n6 / 3 - 1\n\n[1] 1\n\n\n\n\nVariables and Assignment\nIn R programming, a variable is a name given to a R object such as a numeric value that can be used to store, reuse, or modify that object. In R, variable assignments are made use the assignment operator &lt;-. For example,\n\nmy_variable &lt;- 2.5\n\nassigns the numeric value 2.5 to the variable my_variable. Now, we can peform operations to my_variable, for example,\n\n(2 * my_variable)\n\n[1] 5\n\n(my_variable^3)\n\n[1] 15.625\n\n\nMany programming languages use = for assignment. While it is valid to use = in R, best practices dictate using &lt;-.\nSee the tidyverse style guide here for best practices in naming objects in R.\nIf you want to engage further with R programming, we highly recommend the swirl package (Kross et al. 2020) for learning R in R. To install, load, and use swirl, run the following commands in the R console:\n\n# install swirl\ninstall.packages(\"swirl\") # only need to run once\n# load swirl \nlibrary(swirl) # must run in every new R session\n# start swirl\nswirl()"
