## Learning Objectives

After this lesson, students will be able to: 

* Use the `dplyr` functions  `select` and `filter` to manipulate rows and columns of a data frame. 

* Use the `mutate` function to add new columns to a data frame. 

* Use `group_by` to group observations in one or more columns of a data frame by a grouping variable. 

* Use the `summarize` function with the `group_by` function to compute grouped summaries. 

* Use `pivot_longer` and `pivot_wider` functions to perform certain types of reorganizations of a data frame. 

* Use the `join` family of functions to combine separate data sets into one. 

## Readings, etc.

For this lesson, refer to the following readings, etc.:

* Chapter 3 of *Data Science: A First Introduction* by Tiffany Timbers, Trevor Campbell, and Melissa Lee [@timbers2022data]. [View the free online version of the text.](https://datasciencebook.ca/).

* Chapter 5 of *R for Data Science* by Wickham and Grolemund [@wickham2023r]. [View the chapter online](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html)

* The TidyTuesday data repository [@TT].

## Overview

Real world data rarely comes in exactly the right form for the analysis you want to do. This has led to the implementation of methods that facilitate manipulating data in a way that allows us to more easily address some of the common problems with data sets.   



## Preparation for the next lesson

For the next lesson we will begin discussing the exploratory data analysis (EDA) process starting with some data visualization. 

Prior to starting the next lesson, please read [Chapter 4](https://datasciencebook.ca/intro.html) of [@timbers2022data], link [here](https://datasciencebook.ca/intro.html).
